  · To accurately predict the liquid holdup of two-phase flow in multiphase pipelines, leveraging relevant data obtained from previous indoor experiments on gas-liquid two-phase flow, the gray correlation analysis method was used to analyze the influence of pressure, temperature, inclination, pipe diameter, liquid-phase converted velocity, gas-phase converted velocity, and liquid-phase viscosity on the liquid holding of multiphase pipelines, which provided the basis for the determination of the input parameters; A BP neural network optimized based on PSO was used to construct a prediction model for liquid holdup in multiphase pipelines. The model was compared with three multiple regression prediction models, including both linear and nonlinear variants, as well as traditional BP neural networks, and BP neural network prediction models optimized by other algorithms for liquid holdup prediction.
