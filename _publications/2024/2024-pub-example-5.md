abstract: >-
  · Collected relevant data obtained from previous indoor experiments on gas-liquid two-phase flow.<br>
  · Used grey correlation to analyse the effect of seven factors on the liquid holding.<br>
  · Constructed a prediction model for liquid holdup in multiphase pipelines based on PSO optimised BP neural network. <br>
  · Compared the predictive effectiveness of three multiple regression models and three BP neural network models.
