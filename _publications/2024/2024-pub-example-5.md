  We propose IvyGPT, a large language model trained on medical question-answering data and reinforced with human feedback, achieving state-of-the-art performance for clinical conversational agents while containing over 33 billion parameters manageably within a small GPU cluster.To accurately predict the liquid holdup of two-phase flow in multiphase pipelines, leveraging relevant data obtained from previous indoor experiments on gas-liquid two-phase flow, the gray correlation analysis method was used to analyze the influence of pressure, temperature, inclination, pipe diameter, liquid-phase converted velocity, gas-phase converted velocity, and liquid-phase viscosity on the liquid holding of multiphase pipelines, which provided the basis for the determination of the input parameters; A BP neural network optimized based on PSO was used to construct a prediction model for liquid holdup in multiphase pipelines. The model was compared with three multiple regression prediction models, including both linear and nonlinear variants, as well as traditional BP neural networks, and BP neural network prediction models optimized by other algorithms for liquid holdup prediction. The results indicate that, in contrast to the conventional BP model, both the algorithm-optimized BP and the nonlinear multiple regression model display improved predictive performance. The multiple linear regression model performs the least accurately. Among them, the PSO-BP prediction model achieves a mean absolute error of 0.0452, a root mean square error of 0.0614, and a R-squared value of 0.9279 and demonstrates minimal errors and a high degree of fit. Moreover, under high liquid holdup conditions, the PSO-BP model maintains better prediction accuracy compared to other models, indicating that the PSOBP model is suitable for predicting the liquid holdup of multiphase pipelines.
