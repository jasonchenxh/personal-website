  · Derived a new numerical model of rough-walled fractures that innovatively simplifies the fracture surface.
  · Proposed a concept of effective fracture aperture that varies nonlinearly with the CH4 extraction process. 
  · Constructed a CFD model of methane extraction using COMSOL Multiphysics, in which the governing equations for gas diffusion and seepage influenced by the new numerical model were imported.
  · Analyzed the dynamic effect of roughness, stagger degree and shape of rough elements on CH4 migration.
